"Reason codes explain a change in the anticipated timing of a delivery. Acceptable delays (AD codes) are unforeseeable delays that are beyond GHSC-PSM’s manageable control. They are considered acceptable reasons to change the Agreed Delivery Date (ADD), with USAID mission or COR approval. Unacceptable delays (UD codes) are foreseeable or within GHSC-PSM’s manageable control. They are not valid reasons to change a delivery commitment (i.e. the ADD), but may be used when updating the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD). Supplier delays (SD codes) are an additional set of codes used to explain changes in supplier goods availability or delivery timelines. ",,
"Multiple reason codes may be applied to an order line item during its life cycle. In these cases, only the most recently applied reason codes will be listed in the accompanying USAID GHSC-PSM Health Commodity Delivery Dataset.",,
